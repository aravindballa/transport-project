# Modern Transport
A transport system which uses a new type of passes for faster identification of passengers. The passess contain QR codes. Each passenger
or say traveller is given a unique QR code which is identified by the app given to the ticket collector or a bus
conductor.

### Requirements
- A PHP server as there are connections with database. I used XAMPP server with MySQL database. The database must contain the tables and feilds mentioned in the php files.
- Web Cam is required as it has to scan the qr code.

The scanner and the generator used in this project were made using [QR Code api](http://goqr.me/api). Huge shoot-out for that!
